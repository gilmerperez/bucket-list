# Bucket List

## Description

The **Bucket List** project is a React-based application that allows users to create, manage, and organize their bucket-list items. Users can add new items, set an eagerness level, view a list of their bucket-list items with color-coded priority levels, and edit or delete items as needed.

This project focuses on implementing core React concepts, such as managing state with the `useState` Hook, passing data as props, and rendering lists dynamically using `.map()`. It also emphasizes updating components efficiently to provide an interactive and seamless user experience.

By working on this project, you will gain hands-on experience with key React functionalities, including:
- Handling user input through form elements.
- Using state to dynamically update and render UI elements.
- Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations within a React application.
- Applying conditional rendering to enhance user experience.

This project is an excellent opportunity to reinforce React fundamentals while building a practical and interactive application.
